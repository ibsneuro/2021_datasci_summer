# Data science summer course 2021

This repository contains the materials for the data science summer course 2021 at the Cognitive and Systems Neuroscience Reserach Hub, University of South Australia. The course is designed to be an introduction to basics of data science using R, including data visualisation, transformation / wrangling, import and tidying. It also covers reproducibility using RMarkdown and tips for a reproducible workflow, as well as touching on the motivation for and principles of open science.

Given the brevity of the course (5 days) and that it does not presuppose any prior knowledge, it is intended as a foundation on which future, self-directed learning can build. Statistical modelling is beyond the scope of the course.
