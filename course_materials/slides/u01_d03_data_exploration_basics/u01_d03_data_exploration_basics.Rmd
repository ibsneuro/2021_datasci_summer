# Reproducibility checklist

<br>

### What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?

* Are the tables, figures (and any other results reported) reproducible from the code and data?
* Does the code actually do what you think it does?
* In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

### Reproducibility toolkit

- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R
- Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ R Markdown
- Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub (**more on this later**)

# R console

* this is where the "magic happens", i.e. where the calculations take place
* think of a calculator on steroids `r emo::ji("joy")`
* we can interact with the console directly (see example)
* mostly, however, we will be working with scripted input

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
