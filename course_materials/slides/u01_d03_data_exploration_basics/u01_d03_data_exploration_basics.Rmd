# Reproducibility checklist

<br>

### What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?

* Are the tables, figures (and any other results reported) reproducible from the code and data?
* Does the code actually do what you think it does?
* In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

### Reproducibility toolkit

- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R
- Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ R Markdown
- Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub (**more on this later**)
